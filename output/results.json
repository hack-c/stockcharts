      "summary": "NVDA is in a multi-month consolidation phase (rectangle pattern) following its parabolic advance, with the primary trend still bullish as evidenced by price holding above the 200-day MA and the weekly P&F uptrend line remaining intact. The stock faces immediate resistance at 190-196 and strong support at the 200-day MA (173). Given the upcoming earnings catalyst and the current neutral technical posture within the trading range, traders should wait for a decisive breakout above 196 on heavy volume to confirm continuation of the primary uptrend before adding to positions."
